Menthub is a full-stack web platform designed to bridge the gap between college students seeking guidance (mentees) and those who are ready to offer support (mentors) â€” all within the same academic environment. It facilitates seamless mentor-mentee connections, fosters community-driven learning, and promotes a culture of shared growth and collaboration.

This platform empowers students to:

Get help from peers in academics, internships, placements, time management, and more.

Volunteer as mentors based on their experiences and strengths.

Make informed mentorship choices through intelligent matching and profile-based filtering.# Menthub
